It is not a special action, it only counts as playing a land when determining if a player can play a land this turn.\n• A spell can be cast for its primal cost at any point during a player's turn, as long as the number of lands that player can play this turn is greater than the number of lands they has already played this turn, even if timing restrictions would normally prevent playing a land. This means a spell may be cast for its primal cost during its owner's upkeep or end step, but not during another player's turn, or during a turn where lands can't be played.\n• Additional land plays allow you to play additional cards for their primal cost in a turn if they have no requirements.\n***Example*** *Verdant Expanse says \"You may play an additional land on each of your turns.\" It will allow you to cast two spells for their primal costs. Yngou the Snowbeast says \"You may play any number of snow lands on each of your turns.\" It will not allow you to cast multiple spells for their primal costs.*",

For example, Cursed Scroll will know the name of a card with prophecy, but it can't be put into a Fact or Fiction pile or chosen during the resolution of Gifts Ungiven.\n• A card can't be cast for its prophecy cost if it was exiled by an effect other than its prophecy ability.\n• The triggered ability that allows you to cast a card with prophecy from exile can be countered.",

When you reveal this card this way, you may cast it by paying (cost) rather than its mana cost.\"\n• Casting a spell with quickdraw ignores all normal timing restrictions for the spell. Effects can still prevent players from casting the spell or increase the mana cost to cast it.\n• The triggered ability that allows you to cast a spell for its quickdraw cost can be countered.\n• If a spell is cast for its quickdraw cost, other alternate mana costs can't be paid, but other additional costs can be.",

This is a special action that doesn’t use the stack (see rule 116.2b). To do this, show all players that the card representing that permanent is a noncreature card, then cast that card. You still pay its costs, but this is not an alternate cost, so alternate costs can be paid. The effect defining its characteristics while it was face down ends, and it regains its normal characteristics.

The **number of lands in a player's territory** is equal to the greatest number of lands with the same name in their territory. Effects that check for qualities of a player's territory, such as name or type, will check each land in that player's territory.\n• ***Example:*** A player controls Hallowed Fountain (a Plains Island) and Stomping Grounds (a Mountain Forest), the number of lands in their territory will be 1, and the type of their territory will be Plains Island Mountain Forest. If that player plays a second Hallowed Fountain, the number of lands in their territory will be 2, and the type of their territory will be Plains Island.",

If a player would draw multiple cards at once, each card draw is chosen separately.\n• If a cost or nonstatic effect would refer to a player's undefined library and that player has multiple libraries, that effect's controller chooses any library that player has upon resolution and the effect is applied to that library. If that effect has no controller, that player chooses the library instead.\n***Example:*** Enlightened Tutor will shuffle the same library that was searched, and put the found card on top of that same library.\n• Static abilities that refer to a player's undefined library apply to all of that player’s libraries instead.\n***Example:*** Vantage Bridge says \"Play with the top card of your library revealed.\" You will play with the top cards of all your libraries revealed.",
