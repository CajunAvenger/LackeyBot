You will never be able to attempt to draw from an empty additional library.\n• If a player would draw a card while they have multiple libraries and the draw effect doesn't specify a library, that player chooses which library they own to draw from. If a player would draw multiple cards at once, each card draw is chosen separately.\n• If a cost or nonstatic effect would refer to a player's undefined library and that player has multiple libraries, that effect's controller chooses any library that player has upon resolution and the effect is applied to that library. If that effect has no controller, that player chooses the library instead.\n***Example:*** Enlightened Tutor will shuffle the same library that was searched, and put the found card on top of that same library.\n• Static abilities that refer to a player's undefined library apply to all of that player’s libraries instead.\n***Example:*** Portent of the Long Winter says \"Play with the top card of your library revealed.\" You will play with the top cards of all your libraries revealed.",
	"choose": "**Additional Rules: Variable Modals**\n• (When casting a spell....) If the spell is modal, the player announces the mode choice (see rule 700.2). If the number of choices has a currently undefined value, such as “Choose X,” or a value that may change during the process of casting the spell, such as “If this spell was kicked, choose any number instead”, the player chooses any number of modes. When the spell's legality is checked (rule 601.2e), if value is undefined or the value does not match the choices made, the spell is illegal.",
